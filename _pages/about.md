I’m a joint Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Public Policy at Duke University. My research sits at the intersection of public economics, development, and applied econometrics. I have a strong preference for working with administrative data, and a unifying theme of my work—what I think of as Technology and the Economics of Governance—is to ask how governments can harness data, machine learning, and digital tools to design and implement policies more effectively under fiscal and institutional constraints.

My job market paper — Whom Should the Taxman Visit? Evidence from Door-to-Door Tax Enforcement in Indonesia — proposes a Neyman-orthogonal estimator based on the R-learner to identify which taxpayers respond most to in-person enforcement and to make the trade-offs between participation-maximizing and revenue-maximizing strategies explicit. In a nutshell: 
1. **Prioritizing participation** increases both the number of payers and total revenue but **is highly regressive**; 
2. **Prioritizing revenue** yields large fiscal gains with **no change in participation**; 
3. **Standard risk-based strategies** (targeting likely delinquents) **deliver no improvements** in either outcome.

My research agenda includes several ongoing and planned projects, including:
	1.	Low-cost digital nudges for tax compliance in Indonesia.
	2.	Political cycles and deforestation in Brazil.
	3.	The implications of the old-age security hypothesis under pension reform in Brazil.
	4.	The evaluation of a tax-rebate policy in Pakistan.
	5.	Market design and foster care policy in Brazil.
	6.	Double-robust machine-learning methods for causal inference and treatment prioritization.

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a Public Sector Specialist at the World Bank across Brazil, Indonesia, Uruguay, Mexico, Mozambique, and Belize on wage-bill simulations, governance diagnostics, anti-corruption surveys, and taxation research (including field experiments). I have also held research positions at Harvard Business School and at FGV-IBRE in Brazil.

If you are interested in more information about any of these projects—or potential collaboration—please feel free to contact me at  **paulo.antonacci@duke.edu**.
