I’m a joint Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Public Policy at Duke University. My work sits at the intersection of public economics and development. With a with a focus on building data-driven policies that improve governance.

My job market paper — *Who Should the Taxman Visit? Evidence from Door-to-Door Tax Enforcement in Indonesia* — uses causal forests to identify which taxpayers respond most to in-person enforcement, making the trade-offs between participation-maximizing and revenue-maximizing strategies explicit. In a nutshell: 
1. **Prioritizing participation** increases both the number of payers and total revenue but **is highly regressive**; 
2. **Prioritizing revenue** yields large fiscal gains with **no change in participation**; 
3. **Standard risk-based strategies** (targeting likely delinquents) **deliver no improvements** in either outcome.
