I’m a joint Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Public Policy at Duke University. My work sits at the intersection of public economics and development. With a with a focus on building data-driven policies that improve governance.

My job market paper — *Who Should the Taxman Visit? Evidence from Door-to-Door Tax Enforcement in Indonesia* — uses causal forests to identify which taxpayers respond most to in-person enforcement, making the trade-offs between participation-maximizing and revenue-maximizing strategies explicit. In a nutshell: 
1. **Prioritizing participation** increases both the number of payers and total revenue but **is highly regressive**; 
2. **Prioritizing revenue** yields large fiscal gains with **no change in participation**; 
3. **Standard risk-based strategies** (targeting likely delinquents) **deliver no improvements** in either outcome. 

You can find the latest version here: [Job Market Paper (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qodx9itpiat1vxvspoo0p/JMP-Public.pdf?rlkey=p8k3a90d65dcu74db79mge6qq&st=kbwywkgm&dl=0)



I also study: (1) **low-cost digital nudges** for tax compliance (2) **political cycles and deflorestation** in Brazil, (3) implications of the **old-age security** hypothesis under pension reform in Brazil, and (4) the evaluation of a **tax-rebate** policy in Pakistan.


[//]:  Before finishing my PhD, I have worked at the World Bank across Brazil, Indonesia, Uruguay, Mexico, Mozambique, and Belize on wage-bill simulations, governance diagnostics, anti corruption surveys and taxation research (including field experiments). I’ve also held research roles at Harvard Business School and FGV-IBRE.
